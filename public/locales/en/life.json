This marks the creation of the world of JFK-JHK—the initials of John F. Kennedy and Kim. Kim’s work covers numerous topics and industries that have inspired him since childhood. The “Space Oddity” series present spatial experience and ambivalent lives of astronauts, who were Kim’s childhood idols. The “Sea the Wall” collection alarms viewers about the earth’s climate change caused by environmental destruction. “May Be In My Past Life” looks into the supposed perspective of John F. Kennedy on the present, society, and politics. “The Occurrence of Thought” is the collection inspired by the design philosophy and architecture from the 1960s to now, with the stories from Kim’s grandfather, a veteran of the Korean War. “Fashion Component” is a graphic work that reassembles magazines and photos that inspired Kim when he studied fashion design at school."
