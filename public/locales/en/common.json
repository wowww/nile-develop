DAO is realized based on the Neith Protocol composed of a total of 7 components: Station, Trust, Furnace, Staking Pool, Governance, Creator. DAO raises digital funds and distributes DAO Token through the Station. The raised digital funds are managed from the Treasury to DAO’s assets. The asset on consensus objective can be carried out through Trust, where entrusted with DAO’s name and authorization. It proceeds execution and management of the business. Through Trust, the business profits are distributed to the Treasury or Furnace with promised proportions in the smart contract. The profits sent to the Treasury are managed as an asset of DAO. In Furnace, the profit is used to purchase DAO Token being circulated. Purchased DAO token is then burned with proportion on the smart contract and sent to the Staking Pool. As a result, DAO Token’s value rises through circulation reduction and may expect governance rewards through Staking pool. The management standards such as asset use of each DAOs, change of all distribution ratio may set or change through the Governance. The DAO business may proceed with the core IP provider, Creator and the Creator may be granted with partial authority to the business profits.",

The Governance Token may be used to propose an agenda regarding DAO management or for voting. There is an exchange ratio of DAO Token and Governance Token in the Staking Pool, and the relative exchange value of the Governance Token constantly rises as the DAO token is distributed in the Staking Pool.
